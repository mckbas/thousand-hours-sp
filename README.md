I tell others my hobby is learning languages, but if I'm honest my hobby is rather planning what languages I will study, collecting resources and never actually getting very far.

I took one year (two semesters) of Chinese in University and later spent 9 months in South Korea studying Korean. I currently speak Korean at an intermediate level. I am capable of working & comfortably living in the language but not fluent by any stretch of the imagination. 

I was required to study Spanish in school from elementary - high school. However, each year the curriculum was largely the same. We focused on colors + numbers and general nouns. I've had a tumultuous love affair with Duolingo since 2013 (off and on for a decade 🎉) but I can't speak the language.
