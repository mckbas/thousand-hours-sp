It's been eleven days since the end of January and I've already passed my February goal of 50 total hours. I'm now officially level 2! I'm almost completely done with the Super Beginner tag. There are 35 videos remaining - all of them being Pablo's early work. These are all ranked mid/high thirties to mid forties. The current videos I'm watching are all a mix of super beginner & beginner ranked at a difficulty of 33. There are 19 days left in February - so I'm going to see if I can log 40 more hours this month. That's roughly 2 hours of watch time per day and seems quite possible.
