It's been eleven days since the end of January and I've already passed my February goal of 50 total hours. I'm now officially level 2! I'm almost completely done with the Super Beginner tag.
There are 35 videos remaining - all of them being Pablo's early work. These are all ranked mid/high thirties to mid forties. The current videos I'm watching are all a mix of super beginner
& beginner ranked at a difficulty of 33. There are 19 days left in February - so I'm going to see if I can log 40 more hours this month. That's roughly 2 hours of watch time per day and seems
quite possible.

I missed my stretch goal of 90 hours by the end of February. I'm currently sitting at 77 hours. My total February watch time was about 54.5 hours - which is quite good considering there
were about 5 days in February where I was barely able to hit above my goal of 30 minutes per day. Plus there was one day in which I didn't hit my daily goal and only logged 20 minutes. 

My current statistics are:
77 hours | 640 videos | 45 days
 
 Of the 77 hours watched, 30 minutes were logged outside of dreaming spanish when I ventured briefly into podcasts + other youtube channels. 

If I'm honest, I'm feeling a bit burnt out. I don't think I could ever be someone to log 6+ hours per day, daily for extended periods of time in the beginner levels. The content
isn't bad - I just have a very hard time focusing and consuming any media. I've never enjoyed watching movies, tv shows or Youtube videos - so I'm finding it really difficult
to sit and focus.
