I was right about the burn out. February was a strong month and that's proving hard to follow with my devastating lack of motivation. It's been fifteen days since
my last update and I'm not even averaging 1 hour per day. I'm close to triple digits - which I'm hoping will provide a little boost of motivation upon crossing. My new
goal is to cross 150 hours by the end of April.

This month was not a very good one. Out of 31 days in the month I wasn't able to hit my 30 minute goal 6 times. When I look at the month as a whole I feel a bit better.
I logged 30 hours between February 29th and the end of March. It isn't an average of one hour per day - just slightly below. I did watch almost 200 videos this month though.
Seeing those metrics make me feel a bit better about the hours not increasing by much. I'm still on track to make it to 150 hours by the end of April if I can find my motivation
again. 

As for general understanding: Some videos I feel I understand everything, others make me wonder if CI can truly work for me. I don't do much translating in my head but I attribute
that to years of not understanding my surroundings in Korea and getting comfortable with it. Most of the videos I have been watching have all be stuck around the 40 (difficulty) marker.
