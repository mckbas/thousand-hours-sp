I was right about the burn out. February was a strong month and that's proving hard to follow with my devastating lack of motivation. It's been fifteen days since my last update and I'm not even averaging 1 hour per day. I'm close to triple digits - which I'm hoping will provide a little boost of motivation upon crossing. My new goal is to cross 150 hours by the end of April.
