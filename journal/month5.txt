Today I crossed over into the Intermediate hour range! I'm officially a level 3 after 111 days. I think it can be argued that finishing A1-A2 levels in over three months isn't that impressive. However, after learning two other languages to (at least) the A2/B1 level I'm impressed with how much easier I can understand the content at this point. Especially since I've never cracked a Spanish textbook or tried to learn anything about Spanish grammar (outside of Duolingo). 

Optimistically, I'd like to reach level 4 faster than I reached level 3 but I'm not going to stress myself out about it. I'm just happy that I've stuck with my daily learning for over four months! I've never been so consistent and while I was pretty adverse to watching videos/listening as a study route it's proven to be much more effective than my other methods in isolation. 

Here's to another 150 hours! 🍺🇲🇽🇪🇸🇦🇷🇨🇴

Things are going well. I've noticed the intermediate videos being harder but my brain isn't trying to translate yet. I would say it feels like the language is just washing over me and I'm not retaining a big chunk of it. I think I'm going to filter out the intermediate level videos for now and just focus on working through more of the beginner content regardless of video rank.

Additionally I think it could be beneficial to focus on podcasts until I hit around 200 hours. Using beginner/intermediate podcasts would be a good way to get my brain focusing only on the language provided for context clues rather than any visual support that videos offer. I think I'll try this approach until the end of May and then reconsider.

June-August will be interesting months. I'm going to be attending a Korean language program for roughly 10 weeks. The courses are 4 hours per day, 5 days per week and the commute is roughly an hour one way. I plan on using my commute time to start getting Korean input (podcasts etc) so I imagine my Spanish progress is going to drop fairly substantially. My goal is to still hit my 30 minute per day goal at the bare minimum.
