Today I crossed over into the Intermediate hour range! I'm officially a level 3 after 111 days. I think it can be argued that finishing A1-A2 levels in over three months isn't that impressive. However, after learning two other languages to (at least) the A2/B1 level I'm impressed with how much easier I can understand the content at this point. Especially since I've never cracked a Spanish textbook or tried to learn anything about Spanish grammar (outside of Duolingo). 

Optimistically, I'd like to reach level 4 faster than I reached level 3 but I'm not going to stress myself out about it. I'm just happy that I've stuck with my daily learning for over four months! I've never been so consistent and while I was pretty adverse to watching videos/listening as a study route it's proven to be much more effective than my other methods in isolation. 

Here's to another 150 hours! 🍺🇲🇽🇪🇸🇦🇷🇨🇴
