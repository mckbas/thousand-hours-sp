My first month of Dreaming Spanish is complete and I'm feeling quite optimistic about this learning style. In January I managed to log 23 hours watch time for a total of 240 videos watched. The teachers I seem to learn the most from are Agustina, Andrea, Pablo and Shel so far. I've currently stopped watching content from other teachers & have moved onto watching videos from the aforementioned teachers. I feel really comfortable watching videos rated at '23'. After editing the filters to remove other teachers, my videos now are a solid mix of beginner and super beginner content when sorting by 'easy'. The beginner videos don't feel too much more difficult. My goal for February is to surpass 50 total hours and reach level 2.
